# Assessing muscle co-activation dynamics by counting motor-evoked potentials

This repository contains all the data and code underlying my research master project at Vrije University Amsterdam.

The data was collected and provided by Fang Jin. Please see:

## How to Run

Download the repository, then simply run the appropriate R scripts (described below). The scripts rely on certain R packages, which are called at the beginning of the script via `library(packagename)` or `require(packagename)`. If you haven't already, you will need to install these packages via `install.packages("packagename")`.

## Content

There are three folders. The **data** folder contains the data. The **R** folder contains the `R`scripts. The **plots** folder contains the plots, and any plots generated by running the scripts will saved there. 

### The Data

There is one csv file per subject. The first row hold the column names, each subsequent row corresponds to one TMS pulse. Columns 1-8 hold the binary responses for each muscle. Column 9 identifies the stimulation protocol (i.e. which muscle's RMT was used to set the stimulation intensity).

### The Scripts

Below is a brief description of the relevant scripts. Note that there may be additional scripts that are not listed below, as I am currently working on a Bayesian approach to the problem, using `Rstan`.

    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>theme.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Creates a custom ggplot2 theme for plotting. This script will be called by other scripts; you do not need to run it.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>getdata_binary.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Extracts the relevant information from the binary data. This script will be called by other scripts; you do not need to run it. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>plots.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Creates and saves plots from the data. You need to run this script manually. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>stats.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Runs the statistical analysis on the data. You need to run this script manually. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>simulation.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Runs the main simulation and saves the corresponding plots. You need to run this script manually. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        <code>simulation_pmi_n.R</code>
        </td>
        <td>
        Runs the supplementary simulation and saves the corresponding plots. You need to run this script manually. 
        </td>
